## üìä Preview of Prooflab zkVM Analysis

**Prooflab Research Preview** showcases sample technical analyses of leading zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). This preview repository contains 4 comprehensive evaluation reports demonstrating our research methodology and depth of analysis.

### üéØ What Makes Our Research Different

- **Source Code Analysis**: Every report is based on direct examination of source code, not marketing materials
- **Standardized Framework**: 50+ evaluation criteria applied consistently across all systems
- **Technical Depth**: Detailed analysis of proof systems, constraint systems, and implementation specifics
- **Continuous Updates**: Reports evolve with the rapidly changing zkVM landscape
- **No Bias**: Independent analysis with no vendor affiliations

## üìö Available Preview Reports

This preview repository includes comprehensive evaluation reports for **4 leading zkVM systems**:
